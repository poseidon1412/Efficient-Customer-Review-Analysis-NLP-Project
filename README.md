### To launch or host the Flask app on a cloud or localhost, you can follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following:

1. Python installed on your local machine.
2. Flask framework installed. You can install it using the command pip install flask.
3. The trained model file, finale_model, which is required for making predictions.

Steps to Launch the Flask App
1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Inside the project directory, create a new file called app.py and copy the code you provided into that file.
3. Place the trained model file, finale_model, in the same directory as app.py.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the following command to start the Flask app:

   python app.py

This will start the Flask development server, and you should see output similar to the following:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Once the server is running, you can access the app by opening a web browser and navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Note: If you want to specify a different host or port, you can modify the app.run() line in the code. For example

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)

This will make the app accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:8080/`.

### Hosting on Cloud Platforms

various cloud services offers varying methods of deployment using local host deployment as exampke adust accordingly
